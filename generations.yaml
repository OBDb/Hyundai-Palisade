    description: "The Hyundai Palisade is the brand's flagship three-row SUV, introduced to replace the Santa Fe XL (formerly called the Santa Fe in three-row form). Built on a platform shared with the Kia Telluride, it features bold, upright styling with a massive cascading grille, vertical LED daytime running lights, and an imposing presence that signals its position at the top of Hyundai's SUV lineup. Powered by a 3.8L V6 engine producing 291 HP and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and available with front-wheel or HTRAC all-wheel drive systems. The interior represents one of Hyundai's most premium efforts, with available features including a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, head-up display, quilted Nappa leather seating, and ambient lighting. Seating configurations include eight-passenger (with a second-row bench) or seven-passenger (with second-row captain's chairs) layouts, with impressive space in all three rows and one-touch mechanisms to ease access to the third row. Safety technology is comprehensive with Hyundai's SmartSense suite including forward collision avoidance, blind-spot collision avoidance, rear cross-traffic collision avoidance, and Highway Driving Assist. A significant refresh for the 2023 model year updated the exterior styling with a more squared-off grille, redesigned headlights, and enhanced interior technology including a larger standard infotainment screen and added features. The Palisade established Hyundai's credibility in the three-row premium SUV segment, offering near-luxury appointments and features at a mainstream price point, challenging established players like the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, and Ford Explorer while also drawing comparisons to luxury-brand SUVs costing significantly more."
